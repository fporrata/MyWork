After checking the database and trying a few queries, I decided to fix the deficiencies in the database.  There are no indexes to the necessary fields and spaces need to be removed.   This allows me to practice DDL and DML commands.

**PREPROCESSING OF TABLES**

FIX Movie Table


```python
#year field is messy.  It has ROMAN numerals and the year itself is in the last four characters of the string.  I am 
#creating a yearfixed field

conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
# Cursor object
cursor  = conn.cursor()
query = " ALTER TABLE Movie "
query += "     ADD yearfixed INTEGER; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()
conn.close()

```


```python
#removing spaces to TEXT columns.  This will allow me to not use TRIM on fields used for joins which I can then create an index.
#This has GREATLY improved the performance of the queries.
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
query = " UPDATE Movie set MID = TRIM(MID), title = TRIM(title), yearfixed = CAST(substr(year, -4) AS INTEGER); "
cursor  = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
query = "CREATE INDEX ix_Movie_MID ON Movie (MID); "
cursor  = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()
conn.close()

1. List all the directors who directed a 'Comedy' movie in a leap year. (You need to check that the genre is 'Comedyâ€™ and year is a leap year) Your query should return director name, the movie name, and the year.


```python
#Version 1 - Just get Genre = Comedy
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
query = "SELECT DISTINCT Person.name as director_name, Movie.title as movie_name, yearfixed as year "
query += "FROM Genre INNER JOIN M_Genre ON  M_Genre.GID = Genre.GID "
query += " INNER JOIN  Movie ON Movie.MID = M_Genre.MID "
query += " INNER JOIN  M_Director ON Movie.MID = M_Director.MID "
query += " INNER JOIN  Person on Person.PID = M_Director.PID "
query += " WHERE Genre.Name = 'Comedy' and ((yearfixed % 4 = 0) and (yearfixed % 100 != 0) or (yearfixed % 400 = 0));"
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(result)
conn.close()
```

     a. For each year, count the number of movies in that year that had only female actors.<br/>
     b. Now include a small change: report for each year the percentage of movies in that year with only female actors, and the total number of movies made that year. For example, one answer will be: 1990 31.81 13522 meaning that in 1990 there were 13,522 movies, and 31.81% had only female actors. You do not need to round your answer.


```python
#a. Select all the movies with female actors and remove the ones that had a male actor.  Use of NOT IN 
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
query = "select yearfixed as year, count(Movie.Title) as number_of_movies "

query += " where Person.Gender = 'Male')  "
query += " GROUP BY  yearfixed; "
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

6. Find the film(s) with the largest cast. Return the movie title and the size of the cast. By "cast size" we mean the number of distinct actors that played in that movie: if an actor played multiple roles, or if it simply occurs multiple times in casts, we still count her/him only once.


```python
#Use count(distinct()) to determine unique members of the cast

conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')

query = " Select Movie.title, count(distinct(Person.name)) as Total_Cast "
query += "FROM Movie INNER JOIN  M_Cast ON Movie.MID = M_Cast.MID "
query += " INNER JOIN  Person on Person.PID = M_Cast.PID "
query += " GROUP BY  Movie.title "
query += " ORDER BY  count(distinct(Person.name)) DESC LIMIT 1; "
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(result)
conn.close()
```

    0  Ocean's Eight         238
    

7. A decade is a sequence of 10 consecutive years. For example, say in your database you have movie information starting from 1965. Then the first decade is 1965, 1966, ..., 1974; the second one is 1967, 1968, ..., 1976 and so on. Find the decade D with the largest number of films and the total number of films in D.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
cursor  = conn.cursor()

#Total movies per year
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Movies_per_year AS "
query += " Select yearfixed as year, count(Movie.Title) as Total_movies "
query += " FROM Movie "
query += " GROUP BY  yearfixed; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#define decades
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Decades AS "
query += " Select distinct yearfixed as first_year, yearfixed + 9 as last_year, (CAST(yearfixed as TEXT) || '-' || CAST(yearfixed + 9 AS TEXT)) as decade  "
query += " FROM Movie ;"
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#Use CROSS JOIN to determine the movies per decade
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Movies_per_decade AS "
query += " SELECT Decades.decade, SUM(Movies_per_year.Total_movies) AS sum_movies  "
query += " FROM Movies_per_year CROSS JOIN Decades "
query += " WHERE Movies_per_year.year BETWEEN Decades.first_year AND Decades.last_year "
query += " GROUP BY Decades.decade ;"
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#get the decade with most movies by using LIMIT 1 and DESC
query = " select decade , sum_movies as total_movies FROM Movies_per_decade "
query += " order by sum_movies DESC "
query += " LIMIT 1 ; "
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(result)
conn.close()



```

8. Find the actors that were never unemployed for more than 3 years at a stretch. (Assume that the actors remain unemployed between two consecutive movies).


```python
#ONLY WORKS WITH sqlite version 3.25 and above

conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
cursor  = conn.cursor()

#get the actors and the years they were in a movie
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Actors_year AS "
query += " SELECT DISTINCT Person.name as actor, yearfixed as year "
query += " FROM Movie INNER JOIN M_Cast ON  Movie.MID = M_Cast.MID "
query += " INNER JOIN  Person on Person.PID = M_Cast.PID; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#use the LAG function to determine the number of years between movies
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Actors_lag AS "
query += " SELECT  actor, year, (year - LAG(year, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY actor ORDER BY year)) diff "
query += " FROM Actors_year "
query += " ORDER BY actor; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#Select the max difference of years for each actors assuming that there can not be a difference of 100 years between movies.
#This query also removes actors who have benn in just one movie.
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Actors_diff AS "
query += " SELECT actor, MAX(diff) AS max_unemployed_years "
query += " FROM Actors_lag "
query += " WHERE (diff < 100) "
query += " GROUP BY actor; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#Select the actors where the max difference has been 3 years or less
query = " select actor from Actors_diff "
query += " where max_unemployed_years <=3 ;"
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
print(result)
conn.close()

10. The Shahrukh number of an actor is the length of the shortest path between the actor and Shahrukh Khan in the "co-acting" graph. That is, Shahrukh Khan has Shahrukh number 0; all actors who acted in the same film as Shahrukh have Shahrukh number 1; all actors who acted in the same film as some actor with Shahrukh number 1 have Shahrukh number 2, etc. Return all actors whose Shahrukh number is 2.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('Db-IMDB.db')
cursor  = conn.cursor()

#get the MID of Shah Rukh Khan movies
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Movies_by_Shahrukhkhan AS "
query += " SELECT DISTINCT M_Cast.MID as MID "
query += " FROM M_Cast INNER JOIN  Person on Person.PID = M_Cast.PID  "
query += " where LTRIM(RTRIM(Person.name)) = 'Shah Rukh Khan'; "
cursor.execute(query)

query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Cast_with_Shahrukhkhan AS "
query += " Select distinct M_Cast.PID as PID "
query += " FROM M_Cast where  M_Cast.MID IN (SELECT MID FROM  Movies_by_Shahrukhkhan) ; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#Get the movies of the coactors of Shah Rukh Khan
query = " CREATE TEMP TABLE Movies_of_coactors AS "
query += " Select M_Cast.MID from M_Cast WHERE PID IN (Select PID FROM Cast_with_Shahrukhkhan) ; "
cursor.execute(query)
conn.commit()

#Shahrukh number 2.  Do not include Shahrukh number 1 (NOT IN)
query = "Select distinct Person.name from M_Cast INNER JOIN  Person on Person.PID = M_Cast.PID "
